> ### Pipeline of a scene
> - [ ] None
> - [B] B - Rough script phase where I get down most but not necessarily all of the dialogue and annotate music and visual effects.
> - [O] O - First implementation phase. After enough foundation has been written down I make the visual and sound to go along with it. The script changes a lot in this phase too.
> - [t] t - Review phase. Have another pair of eyes go through it, locate changes to make.
> - [f] f - Readjust phase. Make the changes, back to review phase until done.
> - [x] Done
